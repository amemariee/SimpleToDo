## Notes

While building the app I did encounter some challenges. One of these occurred when sharing the project from Android Studios to GitHub a 401 Unauthorized error would show.
This was resolved by using a token which then allowed me to import the app. Another challenge I ran into was during the File Utils Import, after some troubleshooting this
was resolved when adding 'org.appche.' to the start of the depencices implementation in the build.gradle file. 

Overall through building this ToDo app I have learned a significant amount about Android Studios and I am excited to continue to develop this app more.
